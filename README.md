Smart Contract 
Welcome to my blockchain learning log! Over the past 5 days, Iâ€™ve immersed myself in Ethereum smart contract development and successfully deployed my first contract on a testnet. Here's everything I've accomplished so far:

ðŸ“… Timeline Overview
Day	Topics Covered	Key Outcomes
1	âœ… Introduction to Blockchain, Ethereum, Solidity	Understood blockchain fundamentals, EVM, Solidity syntax
2	âœ… Remix IDE, Variables, Functions	Practiced writing, compiling, and deploying simple contracts
3	âœ… Structs, Arrays, Storage & Memory in Solidity	Built complex data structures using structs and dynamic arrays
4	âœ… Deployed First Smart Contract to zkSync Sepolia Testnet	Gained hands-on experience with wallet setup, Sepolia faucet, contract deployment
5	âœ… Contract Verification, Etherscan Explorers	Located my contract on zkSync Sepolia Explorer, learned how to verify and interact
